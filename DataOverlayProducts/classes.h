// 1) The system is not able to deal with
//    art::Wrapper<std::vector<std::string> >;
//    The problem is somewhere inside root's reflex mechanism
//    and Philippe Canal says that it is ( as of March 2010) a
//    known problem.  He also says that they do not have any
//    plans to fix it soon.  We can always work around it 
//    by putting the string inside another object.

// Only include objects that we would like to be able to put into the event.
// Do not include the objects they contain internally.
